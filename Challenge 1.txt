- A test plan:
I will test stick to the main function first (search insurers, filter and sort,...) 
then will follow other sub flow (elements visible check, layout responsive,...)

- The tool(s) you would use to test it:
I'm using Visual Code / Katalon for automation scripts
I'm using Edge Chromium for browser, which is similar to Chrome

- The architecture of the test scripts in that tool:
Robot Framework / Selenium
Java OOP
